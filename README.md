#  Inventory Management System using Machine Learning

##  Project Overview
This project aims to optimize inventory tracking and management by leveraging machine learning techniques. The system predicts product demand based on historical data, helping businesses maintain ideal stock levels, reduce overstocking/understocking, and improve decision-making.

##  Features
- Predicts future inventory requirements using ML algorithms
- Tracks and analyzes product sales trends
- Prevents stock-outs and overstocking issues
- Visualizes demand forecasts and inventory performance
- Exports predictions to CSV for easy reporting

##  Machine Learning Techniques
- Linear Regression / Random Forest Regressor (based on dataset)
- Time Series Forecasting (optional)
- Model evaluation using RÂ² Score, RMSE, MAE

##  Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** â€“ for data processing
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ for building and evaluating ML models
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** â€“ for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** â€“ for code development

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- Historical sales/inventory data in `.csv` format
- Features: product ID, date, quantity sold, stock level, etc.

## ðŸ“· Sample Workflow
1. Load and clean the dataset
2. Visualize product sales and trends
3. Train ML model to predict future stock demand
4. Evaluate model performance
5. Output predicted inventory needs
